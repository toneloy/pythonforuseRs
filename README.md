## Python for useRs

I decided to write this notebook to annotate my own experience in translating R to Python, as my current job is done almost entirely in Python. 

I'm a huge fan of the `tidyverse` and it's philosofy of reducing the programmer's time first and then the CPU time. So, for many things that I can acomplish in R with just a few **readable** lines of code, I had to google how to do them in `pandas` and very often the solution is an obscure piece of *hack*.

I imagine that this can happen to other people, and that's why I decided to share it. So, here we go!
